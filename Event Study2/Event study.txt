an event study profile of a specific "known" event on S&P 500 stocks, and compare its impact on two groups of stocks.

The event is defined as when the actual close of the stock price drops below $5.00, more specifically, when:

    price[t-1] >= 5.0
    price[t] < 5.0 

an event has occurred on date t. Note that just because the price is below 5 it is not an event for every day that it is below 5, only on the day it first drops below 5.

Evaluate this event for the time period January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2009. Compare the results using two lists of S&P 500 stocks: 1) The stocks that were in the S&P 500 in 2008 (sp5002008.txt), and 2) the stocks that were in the S&P 500 in 2012 (sp5002012.txt). These equity lists are in the directory QSData/Yahoo/Lists.
