work remaining--need to save ouput data as well as each day varitaion data in a csv

Write a Python function that can simulate and assess the performance of a 4 stock portfolio.

Inputs to the function include:

    Start date
    End date
    Symbols for for equities (e.g., GOOG, AAPL, GLD, XOM)
    Allocations to the equities at the beginning of the simulation (e.g., 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.1)

The function should return:

    Standard deviation of daily returns of the total portfolio
    Average daily return of the total portfolio
    Sharpe ratio (Always assume you have 252 trading days in an year. And risk free rate = 0) of the total portfolio
    Cumulative return of the total portfolio

An example of how you might call the function in your program:

vol, daily_ret, sharpe, cum_ret = simulate(startdate, enddate, ['GOOG','AAPL','GLD','XOM'], [0.2,0.3,0.4,0.1])
